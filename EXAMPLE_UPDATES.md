## Summary of Corrections

### Removed Outdated Warnings:
- ❌ "Currently works in continuous mode only (discrete has a bug)"
- ❌ "Requires writing C++ code"
- ❌ "Gradient support requires custom_jvp (not implemented yet)"
- ❌ "vmap support requires vmap_method parameter (not implemented yet)"

### Added Accurate Information:
- ✅ "Works in both continuous (PDF) and discrete (PMF) modes"
- ✅ "Build graphs entirely in Python (no C++ required!)"
- ✅ "Full JAX support: jit, grad, vmap"
- ✅ "Automatic C++ code generation for performance"
- ✅ "Gradient computation works!" with examples

## Testing

All example scripts verified:
```bash
# Quick verification test
python test_parameterized_edges.py  # ✅ All tests pass

# Main examples can be run
python jit_pdf.py                   # ✅ Works
python python_graph_to_jax_example.py  # ✅ Works
python ffi_pdf.py                   # ✅ Works
python jit_or_ffi.py               # ✅ Works
```

## Key Messages Now Consistent

All example scripts now consistently communicate:

1. **Python graphs don't require C++**: Build models entirely in Python
2. **Parameterized edges work in both modes**: Continuous (PDF) and discrete (PMF)
3. **Full JAX support**: JIT, gradients, and vmap all functional
4. **Automatic C++ generation**: Performance optimization happens automatically
5. **Ready for gradient-based inference**: SVGD, MLE, optimization all supported

## User Experience

Users will now:
- ✅ Not encounter misleading warnings about bugs or missing features
- ✅ Understand they don't need to write C++ for gradient support
- ✅ Have clear examples of parameterized edges usage
- ✅ Know exactly which features work in which modes
- ✅ Have a quick test to verify their installation

## Files Modified (Summary)

1. ✅ `examples/jit_pdf.py` - Major updates to header and comparison section
2. ✅ `examples/README.md` - Complete restructure with new sections
3. ✅ `examples/python_graph_to_jax_example.py` - Fixed section 2 and all summaries
4. ✅ `examples/test_parameterized_edges.py` - NEW verification script
5. ✅ `examples/ffi_pdf.py` - No changes needed
6. ✅ `examples/jit_or_ffi.py` - No changes needed

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are:
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Non-breaking for existing code
- ✅ Purely documentation and example improvements
- ✅ Reflect actual working features, not aspirational ones
