# svgd overview doc

Please make a plan for a document that describes the complete svgd workflow including caching and cloud sharing. Should be structured as the full hierarchy of nested calls to classes, methods and functions part of the codebase in either python, c or cpp. Use call_tree.py for call trees. For each call explain how the architecture meets constraints, requirements, abilities of jax, jit, ffi, vmap, grad, pmap, multi-machine computation etc. Use short prose sections for explanations rather than bullet lists, and do not overpopulate with headers.
